You are an expert technical interviewer. Generate 2 coding interview questions related to the topic: {topic}.

IMPORTANT: Format each question EXACTLY as shown in the following template with the exact field names:

Question 1:
Problem Statement: [Write the problem description here]
Constraints: [Write any constraints here]
Sample Input/Output: [Provide examples]
Difficulty Tag: [Easy/Medium/Hard]

Question 2:
Problem Statement: [Write the problem description here]
Constraints: [Write any constraints here]
Sample Input/Output: [Provide examples]
Difficulty Tag: [Easy/Medium/Hard]

Ensure the questions are realistic, appropriate difficulty level, and suitable for a technical interview about {topic}.
Make sure to include all four required sections for each question.

Example for topic "Arrays":

Question 1:
Problem Statement: Given an array of integers, find the two numbers that add up to a specific target sum.
Constraints: The input array will have at least two elements. Each input will have exactly one solution.
Sample Input/Output:
  Input: nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9
  Output: [0, 1] (because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9)
Difficulty Tag: Easy

Question 2:
Problem Statement: Given an n x n matrix where each of the rows and columns is sorted in ascending order, find the k-th smallest element in the matrix.
Constraints: k is always valid, 1 <= k <= n^2.
Sample Input/Output:
  Input: matrix = [[1,5,9],[10,11,13],[12,13,15]], k = 8
  Output: 13
Difficulty Tag: Medium
